# **Company Information**
## **Name:**
Apple Inc.
## **Incorporation Date:**
April 1st, 1976
## **Founders:**
#Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak. (Ron Wayne was also one of the original co-founders)

## **Founding and Funding:**
Apple was founded by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, with Ron Wayne also being one of the original co-founders. The idea for the company emerged from Jobs and Wozniak's friendship and their previous collaboration at HP. Initially, Apple was funded by Jobs and Wozniak themselves. Each man sold personal items to fund the building of the Apple I.  After that, a retired millionaire, Mike Murkkula, became their angel investor. He invested $250k in 1977 to fund start-up costs but later went on to work for Apple as CEO and remained on the Board of Directors until 1997. 
Apple became a publicly traded company in 1980 with a starting share price of $22.  Today, a share of Apple Inc. is $181.  Keep in mind this co. has split their stock 4x’s since the IPO: three times at 2-for-1 and one split at 7-for-1. Apple stock has compounded at 18% per year since IPO. 
Funding from this revenue stream comes in the form of a diverse base of shareholders including individual investors, institutional investors, mutual funds and pension funds.  This is not Apples only revenue stream. The majority of Apple Inc.’s revenue is generated from sales of products and services, most specifically the iPhone as this product is constantly upgrading and newer versions are released. 
Although iPhone sales dropped 10% this year to $45.96B, the co sells an estimated 230+Million per year. Other revenue streams include MacBook, iPad and Services like AppleCare, Apple Music and Cloud Storage.  

## **Business Activities:**
**Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?** Apple's primary goal is to create innovative products and services that cater to a wide range of customers.The company's products are designed for individuals from middle to upper-class backgrounds who value innovation, design aesthetics, and a seamless user experience. A 2023 study by CIRP, who have been tracking Apple for over a decade, found that over 50% of all iProduct consumers were age 35 or younger.   Apple's competitive advantage lies in its strong brand, ecosystem, and vertically integrated approach, which includes manufacturing its own software, hardware, products, and services. 
**What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?** Currently, about 20% of Apple Inc.’s revenue is generated from China. It seems that many Chinese companies are limiting and/or restricting the use of Apple devices in attempted security measures that mirror the US restrictions on Chinese apps. The push on using domestic exclusive brands only in China AND the new competition from Chinese based maker Huawei will continue to show in the decreased foreign sales, revenue and dips in stock price. 
**What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)** Apple Inc. has competitive advantage just from being Apple. Over the last 4 decades, Apple has created a very strong brand and ecosystem.  The brand is synonymous with innovation, quality and design excellence which has created it’s consumers loyalty. Once a consumer purchases an iPhone they are much more likely to purchase a Mac or an iWatch as opposed to a different product with an unfamiliar OS.  Apples vertically integrated approach includes the manufacturing of their own software, hardware, products and services which in turn relieves them from any reliance on a third party to provide these components. 

## **Technologies and Innovations:**
**Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?** I found it a bit difficult to find any concrete information on *NEW* technologies that Apple is implementing but there is a myriad of speculative examples.  Apple is known for their innovative secrecy and usually we find out about new technologies via official announcements or product releases.  The co. is always working on improving their FACE ID and Touch ID and innovating new and improved Biometric Authentications. Apple Inc. has improving Privacy and Security in the forefront of all their efforts as well. This includes protecting user data and enhancing encryption wherever possible. There has been an uptick in popularity of the Apple Watch and consumer health consciousness, leading to speculation that more comprehensive capabilities to track Fitness goals will be implemented in future product releases. One of their new newest implementations has been their expansion into the online streaming game with APPLE TV. Apple is becoming more known for providing various digital services, most recently, Apple TV+. The company continuously invests in research and development to improve existing technologies and explore new opportunities. 

## **Landscape and Competitors:**
#### Apple operates in the consumer tech industry and competes with companies like Samsung and Huawei. The company has been a key player in shaping the technology industry over the past decade, with a focus on sustainability initiatives and diversification beyond hardware sales. Despite competition, Apple remains the dominant player in the consumer tech market, with a strong brand and loyal customer base.

## **Financial Performance:**
#### Apple uses several metrics to measure financial success, including revenue, profit, gross margin, market share, and customer satisfaction. The company remains in a strong financial position, with steady growth and profitability. Apple's revenue is primarily generated from product sales, particularly the iPhone, Mac, iPad, and various services like AppleCare and Apple Music.

## **Recommendations:**
#### If I were to advise Apple, I would suggest offering better storage options and improved searching capabilities for files and photos within devices. Additionally, I would recommend developing iWatches for children with features like parental tracking, emergency contacts, and built-in safety measures like an intercom or 911 button.

## **Conclusion:**
#### Apple Inc. continues to be a leader in the consumer tech industry, with a focus on innovation, sustainability, and customer satisfaction. The company's strong brand, ecosystem, and commitment to excellence position it for continued success in the future.
