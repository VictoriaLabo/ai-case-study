# **Apple. Inc. - Trailblazers of Technology**
## Overview
Apple Inc. stands as an iconic American corporation renowned for its diverse portfolio, encompassing personal computers, smartphones, tablet computers, computer peripherals, and software solutions. Widely revered as one of the globe's most recognizable brands, Apple holds a storied legacy as the pioneering force behind the widespread adoption of personal computing technology.
Distinguished as the trailblazer in the realm of personal computing, Apple achieved a historic milestone by spearheading the advent of the graphical user interface (GUI). This groundbreaking innovation revolutionized the way individuals interacted with computers, democratizing access to technology and empowering users with intuitive, visually-driven interfaces. In doing so, Apple not only shaped the trajectory of the computing industry but also catalyzed a cultural shift towards a more user-friendly, accessible digital landscape.
## **Company Information**
## Name:
Apple Inc.
## Incorporation Date:
April 1st, 1976
## **Founding and Funding:**
Apple was founded by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, with Ron Wayne also being one of the original co-founders. The idea for the company emerged from Jobs and Wozniak's friendship and their previous collaboration at HP. Initially, Apple was funded by Jobs and Wozniak themselves. Each man sold personal items to fund the building of the Apple I.  After that, a retired millionaire, Mike Murkkula, became their angel investor. He invested $250k in 1977 to fund start-up costs but later went on to work for Apple as CEO and remained on the Board of Directors until 1997. 
Apple became a publicly traded company in 1980 with a starting share price of $22.  Today, a share of Apple Inc. is $181.  Keep in mind this co. has split their stock 4x’s since the IPO: three times at 2-for-1 and one split at 7-for-1. Apple stock has compounded at 18% per year since IPO. 
Funding from this revenue stream comes in the form of a diverse base of shareholders including individual investors, institutional investors, mutual funds and pension funds.  This is not Apples only revenue stream. The majority of Apple Inc.’s revenue is generated from sales of products and services, most specifically the iPhone as this product is constantly upgrading and newer versions are released. 
Although iPhone sales dropped 10% this year to $45.96B, the co sells an estimated 230+Million per year. Other revenue streams include MacBook, iPad and Services like AppleCare, Apple Music and Cloud Storage.  

## **Business Activities:**
**Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?** Apple's primary goal is to create innovative products and services that cater to a wide range of customers.The company's products are designed for individuals from middle to upper-class backgrounds who value innovation, design aesthetics, and a seamless user experience. A 2023 study by CIRP, who have been tracking Apple for over a decade, found that over 50% of all iProduct consumers were age 35 or younger.   Apple's competitive advantage lies in its strong brand, ecosystem, and vertically integrated approach, which includes manufacturing its own software, hardware, products, and services. 
**What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?** Currently, about 20% of Apple Inc.’s revenue is generated from China. It seems that many Chinese companies are limiting and/or restricting the use of Apple devices in attempted security measures that mirror the US restrictions on Chinese apps. The push on using domestic exclusive brands only in China AND the new competition from Chinese based maker Huawei will continue to show in the decreased foreign sales, revenue and dips in stock price. 
**What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)** Apple Inc. has competitive advantage just from being Apple. Over the last 4 decades, Apple has created a very strong brand and ecosystem.  The brand is synonymous with innovation, quality and design excellence which has created it’s consumers loyalty. Once a consumer purchases an iPhone they are much more likely to purchase a Mac or an iWatch as opposed to a different product with an unfamiliar OS.  Apples vertically integrated approach includes the manufacturing of their own software, hardware, products and services which in turn relieves them from any reliance on a third party to provide these components. 

## **Technologies and Innovations:**
**Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?** I found it a bit difficult to find any concrete information on *NEW* technologies that Apple is implementing but there is a myriad of speculative examples.  Apple is known for their innovative secrecy and usually we find out about new technologies via official announcements or product releases.  The co. is always working on improving their FACE ID and Touch ID and innovating new and improved Biometric Authentications. Apple Inc. has improving Privacy and Security in the forefront of all their efforts as well. This includes protecting user data and enhancing encryption wherever possible. There has been an uptick in popularity of the Apple Watch and consumer health consciousness, leading to speculation that more comprehensive capabilities to track Fitness goals will be implemented in future product releases. One of their new newest implementations has been their expansion into the online streaming game with APPLE TV. Apple is becoming more known for providing various digital services, most recently, Apple TV+. The company continuously invests in research and development to improve existing technologies and explore new opportunities. 

## **Landscape and Competitors:**
Apple operates in the consumer tech industry. The company has been a key player in shaping the technology industry over the past decade, with a focus on sustainability initiatives and diversification beyond hardware sales. Despite competition, Apple remains the dominant player in the consumer tech market, with a strong brand and loyal customer base. **What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5 to 10 years?** Apple has been one of the key players in actually shaping the technology industry in the past decade.  They have grown such a well known and efficient ecosystem that Apple’s influence touch consumer behavior, product development and market dynamics.  Apple has been increasing their focus on sustainability initiatives like using recycled materials and using renewable energy  to reduce its carbon footprint The most notable innovations Apple has implemented was their expansion into the digital services arena.  Apple TV+, App Store, Apple Music, etc. all have helped Apple once again diversify their revenue streams beyond hardware sales. **What are the other major companies in this field?** Samsung is a well know competitor with Apple. Samsung competes directly in the smartphone market with their Galaxy line of products.  Samsung also offers other products like Apple in wearables, tablets and other consumer electronics.   Huawei is a Chinese competitor that has only recently come into play as geopolitical factors have China reconsidering using Apple products as a security measure similar to those taken by the U.S to ban Chinese apps. Apple CEO Tim Cook called China "the most competitive market in the world" as the tech company reported concerning quarter results. In the last 6 months, Apple has seen a 20% decrease in product sales in China as they've implemented restrictions on many workers using Apple products in state/govt. buildings. Huawai has the same technology and the people of China have been preferring the domestic supplier over Apple. **What has been the business impact of this company so far?** Apple has single handedly influenced the masses with their revolutionized mobile and personal computing technology, and will continue to do so with their vertically integrated business model and their cutting edge innovation.

## **Financial Performance:**
**What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?** Apple Inc. uses several metrics to measure financial success, including Revenue, Profit, Gross Margin, Market Share and Customer Satisfaction. After reviewing the co.’s most recent SEC filings, Apple remains in a strong financial position. One large stream of revenue generated from product sales, particularly the iPhone, Mac, iPad, and various services like AppleCare and Apple Music. Comparing six months 2023 P/L to same period in 2024, the company has seen a $6M decrease in their cost to produce products. As this trickles down through their total cost of goods sold, their gross profit margin shows the corresponding increase by $6M. Common stock and additional paid-in capital, $0.00001 par value: 50,400,000 shares authorized; 15,337,686 and 15,550,061 shares issued and outstanding, respectively.
Moving over to the balance sheet, current assets decreased by $15M since Sept 2023. The offset is that Apple was able to reduce their A/P  by $5M and their term debt by $4M since September of 2023.  There were many other changes throughout the different chart of accounts but these were the most significant. Overall, although Apple’s total assets decreased from $352M to $337M, the co. is still in a very strong position as their liabilities decreased $21M in the same period. **How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?** Apple is still the biggest consumer tech conglomerate worldwide due to their stronghold on the market.  No other competitor can touch Apple in that they provide ALL of their products/services/multi device use.

## **Recommendations:**
If I were to advise Apple, I would suggest offering better storage options and improved searching capabilities for files and photos within devices. Additionally, I would recommend developing iWatches for children with features like parental tracking, emergency contacts, and built-in safety measures like an intercom or 911 button. **What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?** 
GPS technology which is already widely used would provide real-time location tracking. A corresponding app on the parent’s phone would allow parents to monitor their SMALL children without being present like when the child in in school or activities.  A button dedicated for emergency situations would be a feature that also can be easily implemented.  This can call 911 direct or better yet the child’s pre-programmed emergency contact.  If that option is not available due to the sensitivity of children accidentally calling 911 or something of that nature, maybe an intercom similar to that of Alexa devices could be incorporated.  This would allow the child to make real time audio messages or send an alert to their parents IPhone.  Bluetooth, Wifi or Data plans could also be used for this (as is with adult watches now) for more reliable connectivity. *IF* this item were to be manufactured, I would like to see some unnecessary but useful features as well. I would like to see some biometric features that would notify parents of increased heart rate ( possibly indicating stress or distress ).  Fall detection is possible would be a neat feature (for elderly as well). There are so many different data sets that parents may want to monitor and being able to analyze specific sensors of our children would invaluable, IMO, esp. those with children with special needs.  A child friendly interface (very basic) and EASY one step commands would also prove to be very marketable in my opinion.**Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?** Most or all the groundwork has already been laid for these technologies.  This coupled with the FUTURE of our world’s safety in OUR hands, it only makes sense to put some of the ENORMOUS profits this company makes into something that can directly help to SAVE a child from enduring a trauma.


## **Conclusion:**
Apple Inc. continues to be a leader in the consumer tech industry, with a focus on innovation, sustainability, and customer satisfaction. The company's strong brand, ecosystem, and commitment to excellence position it for continued success in the future.
